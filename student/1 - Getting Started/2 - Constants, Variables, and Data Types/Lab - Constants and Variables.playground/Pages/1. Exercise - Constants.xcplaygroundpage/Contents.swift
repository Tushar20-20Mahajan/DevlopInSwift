/*:
## Exercise - Constants

 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */
let friends = 750
print("The Number of friends on your social media are \(friends)")

//:  Now assume you go through and remove friends that aren't active on social media. Attempt to update your `friends` constant to a lower number than it currently is. Observe what happens and then move to the next step.
// friends=700

//:  Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function. Go back and delete your line of code that updates the `friends` constant to a lower number so that the playground will compile properly.
print("The code was not able to compile and gave error because it was declared as let and we can't update the value of let defined variable to update we must have used var instead. ")
